                Once upon a time 🕛, a bunch of potatoes 🥔🥔 were discussing the dream of every potato to turn into something delicious &amp; yum!
                Then came along our director, Jijy Mathew with a wonderful vision💡. He had the idea 💭 to turn these adorable potatoes into crunchy flavorsome Maxvita chips. 😋
                When the potatoes heard👂🏻this, they started bouncing with excitement. 🥳🎉<br>
                Their dream had finally come true! 👏🏻
                <br><br>
                Today, Maxvita Foods is one of the leading ☝🏼 snacks foods manufacturing companies in South India. Having started its modern manufacturing unit in Mysore Karnataka in the year 2013, Maxvita is now a major supplier to states around South😊
                <br><br>
                A Happy Potato Is A Maxvita Potato!
